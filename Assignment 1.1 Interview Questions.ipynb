    "1. What is a dictionary in Python?\n",
    "   Python dictionary is one of the supported data types in Python. It is an unordered collection of elements. \n",
    "   The elements in dictionaries are stored as key–value pairs. Dictionaries are indexed by keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is __init__ in Python?\n",
    "   Equivalent to constructors in OOP terminology, __init__ is a reserved method in Python classes. The __init__ method is \n",
    "   called automatically whenever a new object is initiated. This method allocates memory to the new object as soon as it \n",
    "   is created. This method can also be used to initialize variables. \n",
    "    \n",
    "3. What are local variables and global variables in Python?\n",
    "   Local variable: Any variable declared inside a function is known as Local variable and it’s accessibility remains \n",
    "   inside that function only.\n",
    "   Global Variable: Any variable declared outside the function is known as Global variable and it can be easily accessible\n",
    "   by any function present throughout the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What does [::-1] do?\n",
    "   [::-1] ,this is an example of slice notation and helps to reverse the sequence with the help of indexing.\n",
    "   [Start,stop,step count]\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What are decorators in Python?\n",
    "   In Python, decorators are necessary functions that help add functionality to an existing function without changing \n",
    "   the structure of the function at all. These are represented by @decorator_name in Python and are called in a bottom-up \n",
    "   format.\n",
    "    \n",
    "6. How does break, continue, and pass work?\n",
    "   These statements help to change the phase of execution from the normal flow that is why they are termed loop control statements.\n",
    "   Python break: This statement helps terminate the loop or the statement and pass the control to the next statement.\n",
    "   Python continue: This statement helps force the execution of the next iteration when a specific condition meets, instead of terminating it.\n",
    "   Python pass: This statement helps write the code syntactically and wants to skip the execution. It is also considered a null operation as\n",
    "   nothing happens when you execute the pass statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. How can you randomize the items of a list in place in Python? \n",
    "   This can be easily achieved by using the Shuffle() function from the random library as shown below:\n",
    "   from random import shuffle.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Explain split(), sub(), subn() methods of “re” module in Python?\n",
    "   These methods belong to the Python RegEx ‘re’ module and are used to modify strings.\n",
    "   split(): This method is used to split a given string into a list.\n",
    "   sub(): This method is used to find a substring where a regex pattern matches, and then it replaces the matched substring with a different string.\n",
    "   subn(): This method is similar to the sub() method, but it returns the new string, along with the number of replacements.\n",
    "    \n",
    "9. What are Dict and List comprehensions?\n",
    "   Python comprehensions are like decorators, that help to build altered and filtered lists, dictionaries or sets from a given list, dictionary or set. Comprehension saves a lot of time and code that might be considerably more complex and time consuming.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Comprehensions are beneficial in following scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "   Performing mathematical operations on the entire list\n",
    "   Performing conditional filtering operations on the entire list\n",
    "   Combining multiple lists into one\n",
    "   Flattening a multi-dimensional list\n",
    "    \n",
    "10. Is Python fully object oriented?\n",
    "   Python does follow an object-oriented programming paradigm and has all the basic OOPs concepts such as inheritance, \n",
    "   polymorphism, and more, with the exception of access specifiers. Python doesn’t support strong encapsulation \n",
    "   (adding a private keyword before data members). Although, it has a convention that can be used for data hiding, i.e., \n",
    "    prefixing a data member with two underscores.\n",
    "    \n",
    "11. Explain all file processing modes supported in Python?\n",
    "   Python has various file processing modes.\n",
    "   For opening files, there are three modes:\n",
    "     read-only mode (r)\n",
    "     write-only mode (w)\n",
    "     read–write mode (rw)\n",
    "   For opening a text file using the above modes, we will have to append ‘t’ with them as follows:\n",
    "     read-only mode (rt)\n",
    "     write-only mode (wt)\n",
    "     read–write mode (rwt)\n",
    "   Similarly, a binary file can be opened by appending ‘b’ with them as follows:\n",
    "     read-only mode (rb)\n",
    "     write-only mode (wb)\n",
    "     read–write mode (rwb)\n",
    "   To append the content in the files, we can use the append mode (a):\n",
    "     For text files, the mode would be ‘at’\n",
    "     For binary files, it would be ‘ab’\n",
    "    \n",
    "12. What do file-related modules in Python do? Can you name some file-related modules in Python?\n",
    "   Python comes with some file-related modules that have functions to manipulate text files and binary files in a file system.\n",
    "   These modules can be used to create text or binary files, update their content, copy, delete, and more. \n",
    "   Some file-related modules are os, os.path, and shutil.os. The os.path module has functions to access the file system, \n",
    "   while the shutil.os module can be used to copy or delete files.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What is Polymorphism in Python?\n",
    "    Polymorphism is the ability of the code to take multiple forms. Let’s say, if the parent class has a method named XYZ \n",
    "    then the child class can also have a method with the same name XYZ having its own variables and parameters.\n",
    "    \n",
    "14. What is the lambda function in Python?\n",
    "   A lambda function is an anonymous function (a function that does not have a name) in Python. To define anonymous functions,\n",
    "    we use the ‘lambda’ keyword instead of the ‘def’ keyword, hence the name ‘lambda function’. Lambda functions can have any \n",
    "    number of arguments but only one statement.\n",
    "    \n",
    "15. What is self in Python? \n",
    "   Self is an object or an instance of a class. This is explicitly included as the first parameter in Python. On the other hand,\n",
    "   in Java it is optional. It helps differentiate between the methods and attributes of a class with local variables.\n",
    "   The self variable in the init method refers to the newly created object, while in other methods, it refers to the object whose\n",
    "   method was called.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. What is functional programming? Does Python follow a functional programming style? If yes, list a few methods to implement\n",
    "    functionally oriented programming in Python.\n",
    "    Functional programming is a coding style where the main source of logic in a program comes from functions.\n",
    "    Incorporating functional programming in our codes means writing pure functions.\n",
    "    Pure functions are functions that cause little or no changes outside the scope of the function. These changes are \n",
    "    referred to as side effects. To reduce side effects, pure functions are used, which makes the code easy-to-follow, \n",
    "    test, or debug.\n",
    "    \n",
    "17. Write a program in Python to produce Star triangle?\n",
    "\n",
    "   def Star_triangle(n):\n",
    "   for x in range(n):\n",
    "   print(' '*(n-x-1)+'*'*(2*x+1))\n",
    "   Star_triangle(9)\n",
    "    \n",
    "18. What is Enumerate() Function in Python?\n",
    "    The Python enumerate() function adds a counter to an iterable object. enumerate() function can accept sequential indexes \n",
    "    starting from zero.\n",
    "    \n",
    "19. How to generate random numbers in Python?\n",
    "   We can generate random numbers using different functions in Python. They are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    random() – This command returns a floating point number, between 0 and 1.\n",
    "    uniform(X, Y) – It returns a floating point number between the values given as X and Y.\n",
    "    randint(X, Y) – This command returns a random integer between the values given as X and Y.\n",
    "    \n",
    "20. How do you debug a Python program?\n",
    "   By using this command we can debug a python program:\n",
    "   $ python -m pdb python-script.py       "
